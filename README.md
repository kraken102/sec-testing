🕶 Security Testing Notebook

This repo is my scratchpad for security work — pen testing, blue team defense, random experiments, half-broken scripts, and things I didn’t want to lose in the void of my hard drive.

If you’re looking for polished tools with clean docs… wrong repo. This is more like a hacker’s notebook — messy, useful (sometimes), and always a work in progress.

📂 What You’ll Find

Pen test scripts, payloads, and throwaway helpers

Blue team snippets for digging through logs or catching bad guys

Notes, configs, cheatsheets, and general brain-dumps

Random security toys I thought might be handy someday

Basically: it’s a grab bag.

⚠️ Disclaimer

Use at your own risk. Seriously. These are tools, not toys — they can break stuff if you’re careless.

No guarantees. Could be brilliant, could be garbage. You figure it out.

Work in progress. Expect half-finished thoughts, TODOs, and “why doesn’t this work??” notes.

If you run this in production without testing… that’s on you.

🛠 Contributions

Pull requests welcome. Got a cool script? A fix? Something broken you un-broke?
Toss it in. I’ll merge it if it looks useful — or just fork and run your own flavor.

🚧 Status

Always changing. Always messy.
Think of it less like a project and more like opening someone’s hacker journal.
